# Model calibration using kuenm and Maxent
#########

# Description
## The following script helps to perform the process of model calibration using
## Maxent through the R pacakge kuenm. Model calibration consists of a series of
## steps starting in the creation of several models and ending in the selection 
## of parameter settings that produce the best models. To detect which ones are
## the models with best results a robust evaluation process must be performed. In
## this example, models are selected based on statistical significance, omission
## rates based on a predefined Error, and model complexity. The metrics used here,
## are partial ROC, omission rates, and AICc, in that order.

## No data is needed if internet conection is available.

## The main processes are performed using the package kuenm from GitHub. To install
## this package see instructions in https://github.com/marlonecobos/kuenm.


# loading needed package
# assuming that you installed kuenm, load it, if not installed see 
# https://github.com/marlonecobos/kuenm for instructions

# Data used as an example for testing this package correspond to the turkey tick 
# Amblyomma americanum, a vector of various diseases, including human monocytotropic 
# ehrlichiosis, canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and southern 
# tick-associated rash illness.

# These data are already structured as needed for doing analysis with this package, 
# and can be downloaded (from kuenm example data) and extracted using the code below.

# If you have your own data and they are organized as in the first part of Figure 1, 
# in https://github.com/marlonecobos/kuenm change your directory and avoid the 
# code bellow.

# Change "YOUR/DIRECTORY" by your actual directory.
